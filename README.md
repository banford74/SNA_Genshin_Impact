# SNA_Genshin_Impact
A integrated package used for sentiment analysis and emotion word analysis. This package is first applied in one project related to Japanese discussion texts of Genshin Impact. Based on BERT and Japanese pre-trained model "cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese", this model was then fine-tuned by texts related to ACG culture, especially those from "5ch".
